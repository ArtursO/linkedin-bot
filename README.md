# linkedin-bot
This is forked from another project called 'linkedin-bot' which was a JS script for automatic invitations to add to the network of contacts. I have modified it for my needs to connect and log the information I need for our CRM to log our touchpoints. 

# How to use?
* Go to your network on [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/)
* Press the following key combination (Console) :
Ctrl + Shift + I  (You can also go to this [Stackexchange Post on How to Open the JavaScript Console in Different Browsers](http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-to-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers)
* Insert the console javascript code available on this page [github/xingh/linkedinBot](https://github.com/xingh/linkedin-bot/blob/master/linkedinBot.js)

# Settings
* countOfPagesScrolled - responsible for the number of pages that the script will scroll. The default is 5 pages. You can change the number 5 to any other.

#Notice:
Maximum number of contacts - 3000
